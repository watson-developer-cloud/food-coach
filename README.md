# Deploying the application

If you want to experiment with the application or use it as a basis for building your own application, you need to deploy it in your own environment. You can then explore the files, make changes, and see how those changes affect the running application. After making modifications, you can deploy your modified version of the application to the Bluemix cloud.

## Before you begin

* You must have a Bluemix account, and your account must have available space for at least 1 application and 2 services. To register for a Bluemix account, go to https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/. Your Bluemix console shows your available space.

* You must also have the following prerequisites installed:
  * the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) runtime (including the npm package manager)
  * the [Cloud Foundry command-line client](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads)

## Getting the files

1. Download the food coach application code to your computer. You can do this in either of the following ways:

   * [Download the .zip file](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/food-coach/archive/master.zip) of the GitHub repository and extract the files to a local directory, OR

   * Use GitHub to clone the repository locally

## Setting up the Conversation service

1. Make sure you have logged into your Bluemix account using Cloud Foundry. For more information, see [the Watson Developer Cloud documentation](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/common/getting-started-cf.html).

1. Create an instance of the Conversation service in the IBM cloud:

   ```bash
   cf create-service conversation <service_plan> <service_instance_name>
   ```
   Notes:
      * <service_plan>: options include free, standard or premium.
      * <service_instance_name>: this is a unique name of your choosing.


   For example:

   ```bash
   cf create-service conversation standard conversation-ce-tone
   ```

1. Create a service key:

   ```bash
   cf create-service-key <service_instance> <service_key>
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   cf create-service-key conversation-ce-tone conversation-ce-tone-key
   ```

## Setting up the Tone Analyzer service

1. Create an instance of the Tone Analyzer service in the IBM cloud:

   ```bash
   cf create-service tone_analyzer <service_plan> <service_instance_name>
   ```
   ```<service_plan>``` options include standard and premium.  Please note that either of these options will incur a cost.

   For example:

   ```bash
   cf create-service tone_analyzer standard tone-analyzer-ce-tone
   ```

1. Create a service key:

   ```bash
   cf create-service-key <service_instance> <service_key>
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   cf create-service-key tone-analyzer-ce-tone tone-analyzer-ce-tone-key
   ```

### Importing the Conversation workspace

1. In your browser, navigate to your [Bluemix console](https://console.ng.bluemix.net).

1. From the **Dashboard** tab, click the newly created Conversation service in the **Services** list.  It'll have the name you gave it in the previous step (e.g., ```<service_instance_name>```).

   ![Screen capture of Services list](readme_images/conversation_ce_service.png)

   The Service Details page opens.

1. Click the **Launch tool** button.

   ![Screen capture of Launch tool button](readme_images/launch_tool_button.png)

   The Conversation service tool opens.

1. Click **Import** to add the food coach workspace. When prompted, specify the location of the workspace JSON file in your local copy of the application project:

   `<project_root>/ce-tone-conversation/training/ce-workspace.json`

1. Select **Everything (Intents, Entities, and Dialog)** and then click **Import**. The food coach workspace is created.
   * If you have any problems uploading the workspace using Chrome, please try another browser such as Firefox or Safari.

## Configuring the application environment

1. At the command line, navigate to the local project directory (`<project_root>/ce-tone-conversation`).

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file. Open this file in a text editor.

```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

1. Retrieve the credentials from the service key:

   ```bash
   cf service-key <service_instance_name> <service_key>
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   cf service-key conversation-ce-tone conversation-ce-tone-key
   ```

   The output from this command is a JSON object, as in this example:

   ```javascript
   {
     "password": "87iT7aqpvU7l",
     "url": "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/conversation/api",
     "username": "ca2905e6-7b5d-4408-9192-e4d54d83e604"
   }
   ```

1. In the JSON output, find the values for the `password` and `username` keys. Paste these values (not including the quotation marks) into the `CONVERSATION_PASSWORD` and `CONVERSATION_USERNAME` variables in the `.env` file:

   ```
   CONVERSATION_USERNAME=ca2905e6-7b5d-4408-9192-e4d54d83e604
   CONVERSATION_PASSWORD=87iT7aqpvU7l
   ```
Do the same for the Tone Analyzer service, and paste the values into the `TONE_ANALYZER_PASSWORD` and `TONE_ANALYZER_USERNAME` variables in the `.env` file
   ```
   TONE_ANALYZER_USERNAME=mhl715fg-y6h5-2113-6540-ytr78nhs8u64
   TONE_ANALYZER_PASSWORD=124GHaq31M9l
   ```

   Leave the `.env` file open in your text editor.

1. In your Bluemix console, open the Conversation service instance where you imported the workspace.

1. Click the menu icon in the upper right corner of the workspace tile, and then select **View details**.

   ![Screen capture of workspace tile menu](readme_images/conversation_ce_workspace_details.png)

   The tile shows the workspace details.

1. Click the ![Copy](readme_images/copy_icon.png) icon next to the workspace ID to copy the workspace ID to the clipboard.

1. Back on your local system, paste the workspace ID into the WORKSPACE_ID variable in the `.env` file you previously created. At this point, your `.env` file should look like the following:

   ![Screen capture of env file](readme_images/env_file_example.png)

Save and close the file.

1. Install the demo application package into the local Node.js runtime environment:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

1. Start the application:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The application is now deployed and running on the local system. Go to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to try it out.

## Optional: Deploying from the local system to Bluemix

If you want to subsequently deploy your local version of the application to the Bluemix cloud, you can use Cloud Foundry.

1. In the project root directory, open the `manifest.yml` file in a text editor.

1. Specify the following values in the file:

   * In the `applications` section of the `manifest.yml` file, change the `name` value to a unique name for your version of the demo application.

   * In the `services` section, specify the name of the Conversation service instance you created for the demo application. If you do not remember the service name, use the `cf services` command to list all services you have created.

   * In the `env` section, add the `WORKSPACE_ID` environment variable, specifying the value from the `.env` file.

   The following example shows a modified `manifest.yml` file:   

   ```YAML
   ---
   declared-services:
     conversation-ce-tone:
       label: conversation
       plan: standard
     tone-analyzer-ce-tone:
       label: tone_analyzer
       plan: standard
   applications:
   - name: conversation-ce-tone
     command: npm start
     path: .
     memory: 256M
     instances: 1
     services:
     - conversation-ce-tone
     - tone-analyzer-ce-tone
     env:
       NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION: false
       WORKSPACE_ID: fdeab5e4-0ebe-4183-8d10-6e5557a6d842
    ```

1. Save and close the `manifest.yml` file.

1. Push the application to Bluemix:

   ```bash
   cf push
   ```

When the command finishes processing, your application is deployed and running on Bluemix. You can access it using the URL specified in the command output.

# What to do next

After you have the application installed and running, experiment with it to see how it responds to your input.

## Modifying the application

After you have the application deployed and running, you can explore the source files and make changes. Try the following:

   * Modify the .js files to change the application logic.

   * Modify the .html file to change the appearance of the application page.

   * Use the Conversation tool to train the service for new intents, or to modify the dialog flow. For more information, see the [Conversation service documentation](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/conversation/index.html#about).

# What does the Customer Engagement Tone Analyzer & Conversation application do?

The application interface is designed for chatting with a customer engagement bot. Based on a previous laptop purchase, the bot asks how the experience has been and responds accordingly if given a negative or positive response.

The chat interface is in the left panel of the UI, and the JSON response object returned by the Conversation service in the right panel. Your input is run against a small set of sample data trained with the following intents:

    yes
    no
    refund: get a refund on current laptop
    restart: restart the conversation at any point
    tradeIn: replace current laptop with another one
    thanks
    greeting
    help: suggestions on what to say

The dialog is also trained on two types of entities:

    design
    size
    weight

These intents and entities help the bot understand variations your input.

After asking you what you ate (if a meal was consumed), the bot asks you how you feel about it. Depending on your emotional tone, the bot provides different feedback.

Below you can find some sample interactions:

In order to integrate the Tone Analyzer with the Conversation service, the following approach was taken:
   * Intercept the user's message. Before sending it to the Conversation service, invoke the Tone Analyzer Service. See the call to `toneDetection.invokeToneAsync` in the `invokeToneConversation` function in [app.js](./app.js).
   * Parse the JSON response object from the Tone Analyzer Service, and add appropriate variables to the context object of the JSON payload to be sent to the Conversation service. See the `updateUserTone` function in [tone_detection.js](./addons/tone_detection.js).
   * Send the user input, along with the updated context object in the payload to the Conversation service. See the call to `conversation.message` in the `invokeToneConversation` function in [app.js](./app.js).


You can see the JSON response object from the Conversation service in the right hand panel.

In the conversation template, alternative bot responses were encoded based on the user's emotional tone. For example:
